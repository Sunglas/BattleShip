# Project Instructions

## Instructions

Students will be paired in groups of two. Each team will choose a game from a predetermined list and create a simple text-based version of the game written in C++. Each team must research and understand the rules and mechanics of their chosen game.

The objective is to help students practice their programming and problem-solving skills, and creativity.

### List of games:

- Tic-Tac-Toe:
  - A simple two-player game where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3 × 3 grid. The first player to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors:
  - A simple game where a player and the computer simultaneously choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winner is determined by the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
- Word Jumble:
  - A game where players are given a scrambled word and must rearrange the letters to form the correct word.
- Hangman:
  - A word-guessing game where the computer thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess the word one letter at a time. The guesser has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
- Mastermind:
  - A code-breaking game where the computer creates a secret code, and the player tries to guess the code based on feedback about the number of correct and misplaced colors.
- Memory:
  - A game in which players take turns revealing pairs of cards with symbols or letters, attempting to find matching pairs. The player with the most matching pairs wins.
- Blackjack:
  - A popular card game played between a player and a dealer (computer). The objective is to have a hand with a higher value than the dealer’s without exceeding 21.
- Connect Four:
  - A two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The first player to get four discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- *Battleship:*
  - A two-player game where each player places ships on a grid and takes turns guessing the location of the opponent’s ships. The goal is to sink all the opponent’s ships.

### Requirements:

- The game must be written in C++ and run in the console.
- The game must be playable and have clear instructions.
- The game must have a score system and display the player’s score at the end of the game.
- The game must have basic error handling for invalid user input.
- The game must have a `README` file that provides basic and clear documentation on how to run the game It should include...
